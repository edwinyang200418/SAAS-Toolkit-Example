## Design Decisions

### 1. **Enterprise B2B Aesthetic**
- Clean, professional, data-dense design
- White backgrounds with subtle shadows
- Card-based layout for easy scanning
- Ample whitespace for readability
- System fonts for performance and familiarity

### 2. **Progressive Enhancement**

- Falls back to sample data for demos
- All interactions work client-side first
- API calls are asynchronous and non-blocking

### 3. **Responsive Grid**
- Desktop: 2-column layout with sidebar
- Tablet: Single column with sidebar below
- Mobile: Optimized spacing and touch targets

### 4. **Visual Hierarchy**
- Most important metrics at top
- Status and health score prominent on cards
- Color coding for quick status recognition
- Progressive disclosure (cards → detail modal)

### 5. **Interaction Patterns**
- Click card to view details
- Edit/delete buttons on card for quick actions
- Modal forms for data entry
- Inline filters and search
- Hover states for interactivity feedback

## How to Use

### Viewing the Dashboard

1. **Open in Browser**:
   ```bash
   # Simply open the HTML file
   open index.html
   # Or drag index.html into your browser
   ```

2. **With Live Server** (recommended):
   ```bash
