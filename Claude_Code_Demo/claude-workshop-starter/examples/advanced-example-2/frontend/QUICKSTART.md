## API Integration

### Without Backend (Current)
- Uses sample data automatically
- All features work client-side
- Perfect for demos and testing

### With Backend (Future)
To connect to real API:

1. Backend should run on `http://localhost:3000`
2. Implement these endpoints:
   - `GET /api/pilots` - List all
   - `POST /api/pilots` - Create new
   - `PUT /api/pilots/:id` - Update
   - `DELETE /api/pilots/:id` - Delete

3. Dashboard will auto-detect and use API
4. Sample data is replaced with real data

## Customization

### Change Colors
Edit `styles.css` CSS variables:
```css
:root {
    --primary-blue: #2563eb;  /* Change main color */
    --success-green: #10b981; /* Change success color */
    /* ... etc */
}
```

### Modify Sample Data
Edit `dashboard.js` around line 15:
```javascript
this.samplePilots = [
    // Add or modify pilots here
];
```

### Change API URL
Edit `dashboard.js` line 3:
```javascript
this.apiUrl = 'http://your-api-url.com/api';
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **ESC** - Close any open modal
- Click outside modal - Close modal
- Enter in search - Auto-filters

## Mobile View

Try resizing your browser window:
- Desktop: 2-column with sidebar
- Tablet: Single column, sidebar below
- Mobile: Optimized spacing

Or test on your phone's browser!

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard is blank
- Check browser console (F12)
- Verify all 3 files are in same folder
- Try different browser

### API not connecting
- Normal! Dashboard uses sample data
- Check console for "Using sample data" message
- All features still work

### Styles look wrong
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Verify styles.css is loading
- Check for CSS errors in console
